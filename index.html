    A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard.
    It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. 
    Modern consoles often provide a graphical interface that can be used to control machines on a local network (LAN) 
    or provide remote access to remote systems. 
    We have to right click on the screen and inspect then go to the console section.
    We have to use console.log() to print anything on console.
